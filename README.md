# ScrapHub

This is a [Scenic](https://github.com/boydm/scenic/) and [Nerves](https://nerves-project.org) project
to build a small smart home hub. It's not intended to be exstensible or generally useable, but maybe
if others are looking to build something similar they will find it useful as an example.

The eventual goal is to have daily weather reports, to show a list from [Todoist](https://todoist.com)
and control our Philips Hue lights. How long it takes me to get there is anyone's guess because I'm
just doing it for fun.
